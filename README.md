consensus on science - network validation
===========================================

 - How the network validates the truthfulness or accuracy of claims or laws of nature?


Peer review was invented to provide science with a self checking and skeptical feedback mechanism on itself.  In a world of data driven computational science and a backdrop of a ‘reproducibility crisis’ how does science innovate new network validation protocols to provide new immutable evidence trails and guarantee rigour of results or claims? How can it be assured that peer-review supports outliers with new ideas/findings early and strongly?
